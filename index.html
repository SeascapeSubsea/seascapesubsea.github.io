  <h1>SSROV Files</h1>

  <div class="project">
    <h2>Json File</h2>
    <p>The JSON configuration file used in BlueOS is responsible for defining the communication layout and routing for MAVLink-enabled devices within the system. It outlines how devices like flight controllers are connected, specifying details such as baud rates, endpoint addresses, and routing paths. This file is primarily used by the BlueOS MAVLink Manager to establish and manage connections between onboard components and external interfaces like QGroundControl or MAVProxy, ensuring that data flows correctly between subsystems.</p>

    <h2>Param File</h2>
    <p>The PARAM file is used to store and load all firmware parameters specific to the ArduSub autopilot software running on the vehicleâ€™s flight controller. It contains a list of parameter names paired with their respective values, which define the behavior and characteristics of the vehicle, including aspects like sensor calibration, control tuning, and frame configuration. This file plays a critical role in how the vehicle operates, as it directly influences system performance, stability, and mission behavior when loaded into the controller.</p>
